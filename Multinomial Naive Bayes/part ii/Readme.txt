Language: Python 3.6

Concept implemented: Multinomial Naive Bayes

Arguments given to the program are training folder root path and testing folder root path

We have removed the stop words to make the code more accurate. We included all the stop words in a text file and removed all the stop words in data checking against them.

We had displayed whether the file is correctly classified or misclassified.

Then we displayed the total number of files that were correctly classified and total number of files that are misclassified.

Then the accuracy of classification was displayed.

We have used  add-one Laplace smoothing.

We have calculated the logarithm of probabilities to avoid underflow error.

Outputs for some inputs have been given in Output file.
